# Redesign Yelp

A Loyola University Chicago project for COMP 341, Human-Computer Interaction. Our project was to redesign Yelp's website. The team members are Kanyarak Anuchitlertchon, Linette Maliakal, Uljana Sejko, and Janeen Soria.

## Purpose

When we were brainstorming ideas, we wanted to choose an application that is commonly
used. We considered social media, media-streaming, and shopping applications that can be
improved. We discussed the problem domains of different applications. What is their focus?
What are they trying to do? Does their application successfully express its problem domain?
These were questions that we considered when choosing an application. Eventually, we chose
Yelp because we believe that it poorly implements its problem domain of representing
businesses and their customer reviews.

## Tech

We used Proto.io to create our prototype on how we would redesign Yelp's website.

## Getting Started

To access our project, you can simply download the "protoio-Finalize-html.zip" file to view its contents through your device (may work the best on a Mac computer).
